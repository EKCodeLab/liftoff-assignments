# Start Here!
Welcome to Liftoff! We are excited to have you in this course.

You are currently viewing the Liftoff Assignments Repository. 
This repo contains information about all the assignments in the course, 
and will be how you will submit much of your work.

## Repo Explanation
In Liftoff we are focusing on two things: 
1. your Personal Project, (flagged with P#)
   
2. Career Readiness skills. (flagged with C#)
   
Throughout this course you will have assignments related to both of those core areas. Looking through this repo you can see Personal Project assignments, and Career Readiness assignments.



This repository is used with Canvas. 
1. grades will be recorded in Canvas, 
   
2. submit your work through this GitHub repository.

We are making you use GitHub for two important reasons:
<ol>
<li>You will get more practice with GitHub</li>
<li>Your assignments are all stored in one place</li>
</ol>
